I hope that it is ok that this code is public, since I didn't want to have the markers veiw have to request permision the veiw the code. The excel spreadsheet has to be downloaded to be veiwed, this can be done by pressing the file and locating the teensy download button on the right side

q1-sentence.py contains my quite bad code that I quickly wrote for Question 1

q2-splitiing.xslx contains two excel sheets
 - q2: for the small table I made and the full table for 42 
 - q3: just a sheet I used to test my answers

q6-wormholes.py contains the code that I wrote for Question 6. As I wrote in my answer, the code wass originally writen with python in shell mode and me just testing and learning the networkx library, the code in the files just collates the relevant code
